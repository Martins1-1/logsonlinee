## Monorepo & Deployment (client/server)

This repository has been arranged into a monorepo layout with:

- `client/` — Vite + React frontend
- `server/` — Express + TypeScript backend

Quick local run (from repo root):

```powershell
npm run dev:full
```

Environment variables you will need to set in production:

- Server (`server`): `MONGODB_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PAYSTACK_SECRET` (optional), `FRONTEND_URL`
- Frontend (Vite): `VITE_API_URL` (set to your backend HTTPS URL)

If you want me to also replace any other hard-coded API URLs or add CI/deployment files, tell me and I will apply those changes.
